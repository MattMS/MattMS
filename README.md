Hello friend,

My name is Matt (he/him), I live in Tasmania/Australia, and am currently (happily) employed full-time writing mostly dev-ops code but also .NET/web code.
My current main languages are F#, Bicep, and PowersHell.

I most do Azure stuff now, but I liked GCP, and never AWS (I can't support a company that makes employees wear nappies)

My own time is mostly F# and some Racket, and all the other languages I get interested in (Erlang and Haskell seem cool).
I will always have a soft spot for CSS and Python.

I'm terrible at maintaining content on here, as much of my stuff is stored privately in Fossil repos.
One day I'll update my sites.

I have the domain mattms.com and my email address is "matt" on there, which is the best way to reach me.

Thanks for reading.

Hello friend,

My name is Matt, I live in Tasmania/Australia, and am currently (happily) employed full-time writing dev-ops and DBA code (extending on my web + .NET).
My current main languages are F#, Bicep, and PowersHell.

Mostly doing Azure stuff, but I still like GCP. Never AWS (can't support a company that makes empoloyees wear diapers).

My free time is CSS, Python, and Racket, among all the other languages I get interested in (Erlang and Haskell seem cool).

I'm terrible at maintaining content on here, as much of my stuff is stored privately in Fossil repos.
One day I'll update my sites.

I have the domain mattms.com and my email address is "matt" on there, which is the best way to reach me.

Thanks for reading.

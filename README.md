Hello friend,

My name is Matt, I live in Tasmania/Australia, and am currently (happily) employed full-time writing web + .NET code (although more dev-ops stuff these days).
My current main languages are F# and PowersHell.

I also maintain a good interest in CSS, Python, and Racket, among all the other languages I get interested in.

I'm terrible at maintaining content on here, as most of my stuff is stored privately in Fossil repos.
One day I'll update my sites.

I have the domain mattms.com and my email address is "matt" on there, which is the best way to reach me.

Thanks for reading.
